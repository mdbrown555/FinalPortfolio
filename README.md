# <p align="center">Apprenticeship Project Portfolio</p>
### <p align="center">**March 2022 - June 2023**</p>

<p align="center>"A collection of projects I have worked on during the Junior Software Engineer Apprenticeship collaboration between my employer, McKinsey & Company, and Multiverse from March 2022 - June 2023. My portfolio is divided between durable skills I have learned as part of the Risk CMS team at McKinsey supporting users primarily in Salesforce organzations, as well as group projects with fellow Multiverse apprentices and technical initiatives designed to improve the user experience in CMS. The portfolio is intended to be an archive of my work providing explanatory links and Github repositories for individual projects.</p>

## Technical Projects

<details>
  <summary>Universal Profile</summary>
 
- By creating unique permission sets replicating each user profile’s object access within the Salesforce organization, I was able to create a base-level Universal profile for existing users that can be enhanced by adding additional permissions upon request. This streamlines overlapping settings, improves assessment visibility across teams, removes and rearranges unused page sections, and enables constant Engagement Details tab availability to improve usage of common page layouts affecting over 600 internal users across a diverse range of risk assessment teams. This is an ongoing collaborative process involving several team member’s contributions and input, and utilizes constant feedback from users during testing and production rollout.

<details>
  <summary>Exception Apex Trigger</summary>
 
- By creating an Apex class trigger that automatically populates specific fields on the Win-Win object when a record is created or updated, I have enhanced PSE Team user’s ability to parse large collections of data with searchable CE/PE codes, save valuable time from rewriting information that already exists in other records, and communicate mandatory steps to other users outside PSE Team to fulfill registration requirements. This has created a trigger template useful for future logical implementation of adjustments for Win-Win records, and greatly reduced the number of manual changes requested of the Risk CMS Team. Test classes for the Apex trigger were also created to prove code functionality and desired outcomes.

## Durable Skills
<details>
    <summary>LIFE SCIENCES DASHBOARD & PSE REPORTS / DATA VISUALIZATION TOOLS</summary>
- By creating a dashboard used by the Life Sciences Team to assess pending case reviews and reporting metrics used by PRACL (Primary Risk Accountable Cell Leader) users, I was able to create a template the Life Sciences Team can use to build new dashboard components and deliver timely reports to leadership through data visualization. The reports requested through JIRA by the PSE Team are used to collect historical data to identify trends and measure impact, enable searching within list views, and group related records for detailed analysis of leadership participation and case outcomes. This dashboard and the PSE reports enhance the ease of use and availability of reporting information, grants users access to critical data across teams during risk reviews, and enables access to be easily revoked at the end of the review process, facilitating Firm security best practices.

    <summary>SALESFORCE DATA MANAGEMENT</summary>
- By using the Salesforce Dataloader tool to backfill hundreds of thousands of records using simple SQL-like queries, I have saved many hundreds of work hours of manual insertion into relevant tables for future database storage.
