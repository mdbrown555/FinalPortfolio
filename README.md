A collection of projects I have worked on during the Junior Software Engineer Apprenticeship collaboration between my employer, McKinsey & Company, and Multiverse from March 2022 - June 2023. My portfolio is divided between durable skills I have learned as part of the Risk CMS team at McKinsey supporting users primarily in Salesforce organzations, as well as group projects with fellow Multiverse apprentices and technical initiatives designed to improve the user experience in CMS. The portfolio is intended to be an archive of my work providing explanatory links and Github repositories for individual projects.

## Technical Projects

  <summary> ### UNIVERSAL PROFILE</summary>
 
By creating unique permission sets replicating each user profile’s object access within the Salesforce organization, I was able to create a base-level Universal profile for existing users that can be enhanced by adding additional permissions upon request. This streamlines overlapping settings, improves assessment visibility across teams, removes and rearranges unused page sections, and enables constant Engagement Details tab availability to improve usage of common page layouts affecting over 600 internal users across a diverse range of risk assessment teams. This is an ongoing collaborative process involving several team member’s contributions and input, and utilizes constant feedback from users during testing and production rollout.

  <summary> ### Exception Apex Trigger</summary>
 
By creating an Apex class trigger that automatically populates specific fields on the Win-Win object when a record is created or updated, I have enhanced PSE Team user’s ability to parse large collections of data with searchable CE/PE codes, save valuable time from rewriting information that already exists in other records, and communicate mandatory steps to other users outside PSE Team to fulfill registration requirements. This has created a trigger template useful for future logical implementation of adjustments for Win-Win records, and greatly reduced the number of manual changes requested of the Risk CMS Team.

  <summary> ### AWS Glue Migration</summary>
 
Decoupling of applications and data transfer to the cloud from ETL pipeline migration (Snaplogic to Glue) reducing on-premise presence to ease pipeline issues such as data inconsistency & eliminating 100% of latency between database and CMS enabling real time data sharing.
