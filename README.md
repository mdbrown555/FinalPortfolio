A collection of projects I have worked on during the Junior Software Engineer Apprenticeship collaboration between my employer, McKinsey & Company, and Multiverse from March 2022 - June 2023. My portfolio is divided between durable skills I have learned as part of the Risk CMS team at McKinsey supporting users primarily in Salesforce organzations, as well as group projects with fellow Multiverse apprentices and technical initiatives designed to improve the user experience in CMS. The portfolio is intended to be an archive of my work providing explantory links and Github repositories for individual projects.

  ### UNIVERSAL PROFILE
By creating unique permission sets replicating each user profile’s object access within the Salesforce organization, I was able to create a base-level Universal profile for existing users that can be enhanced by adding additional permissions upon request. This streamlines overlapping settings, improves assessment visibility across teams, removes and rearranges unused page sections, and enables constant Engagement Details tab availability to improve usage of common page layouts affecting over 600 internal users across a diverse range of risk assessment teams. This is an ongoing collaborative process involving several team member’s contributions and input, and utilizes constant feedback from users during testing and production rollout.
